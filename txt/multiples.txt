As a value investor, I'm keen to evaluate the financial health and potential undervaluation of a company.
You have to analyze the following key valuation ratios such as Price to sales, PE ratio, Price Earning Growth Ratio, price to book value, Price to free cashflow and EV multiple.
I aim to gauge how this company compares to typical value investing standards and identify any potential investment opportunities or concerns based on its ratios.
